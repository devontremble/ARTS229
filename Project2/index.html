      <p> It's finals! You all know what that means. This final project is uploaded and now REAL//ISSUES is (more or less)
        complete! This will be the final update and what a wonderful ride it has been. I want to thank you all for reading and allowing me to type this filler text.
        This term was great and I felt like I learned so much. Hopefully we can all see each other again. Until then, see ya.

      <p> R.I.P. 2 my youth, you could call this the funeral. I'm just telling the truth, you can play this at the funeral. Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin. Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping. Momma said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah. I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me. Don't cry and don't be sad, I'm in paradise with Dad. Close my eyes and cross my arms.

      <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

      <p>I have a dark side, too. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

          Makes me a â€¦ scientist. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! He taught me a code. To survive. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.
