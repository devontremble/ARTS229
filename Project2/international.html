      <h2>December 12, 2018</h2>
      <p>Occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure...

      <p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. It doesn't look so shiny to me. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Also Zoidberg. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! We don't have a brig. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels...</p>

      <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. God created pudding, and then he rested. Only you could make those words cute. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

      <p>I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. We just call it a sausage. Well, what do you expect, mother? Well, what do you expect, mother?

        Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor...
